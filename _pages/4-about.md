# About Me
#### Hi, I'm Anders
I'm a Senior Manager at [LEGO](https://lego.com) where I've been focusing on digital experiences for kids using technologies such as; native [iOS](http://developer.apple.com) & [Android](https://developers.google.com) development, [Unity](http://unity3d.com) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com).

I produce and host three different podcasts:
* [Film Snak](http://filmsnak.dk) *- Est. Jan, 2014.* Danish podcast where we talk about movies and tv-shows. New episode is released every Monday
* [Krager og Drager](http://kragerogdrager.dk) *- Est. Jul, 2017.* A Game of Thrones podcast in danish where we digest each new episode
* [Postmortem](http://postmortem.fm) *- Est. Nov, 2016.* English podcast where we examines the challenges developers face when creating all kinds of digital games

My hobbies are photography, flying and travel, which I often combine. I started this blog to not only share my perspectives on programming and podcasting, but also to archive and share my photos and videos.
